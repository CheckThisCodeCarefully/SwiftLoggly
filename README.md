## iOS/MacOS import headers

First thing is to import the framework. See the Installation instructions on how to add the framework to your project.

```swift
//iOS
import SwiftLoggly

//macOS
import SwiftLogglyOSX

```
enum LogType {
    case Info
    case Verbose
    case Warnings
    case Debug
    case Error
}

## Example

SwiftLoggly can be used right out of the box with no configuration, simply call the logging function.

```swift


// String
loggly(LogType.Info, text: "Write to the log!")
logglyInfo(LogType.Info, text: "Write to the log!")

// NSDictionary
loggly(LogType.Verbose, dictionary: nsDictionary)
logglyVerbose(dictionary: nsDictionary)

// Dictionary
loggly(LogType.Warnings, dictionary: dictionary)
logglyWarnings(dictionary: nsDictionary)

// Just for fun!!
loggly(LogType.Info, text: "Welcome to Swift Loggly")
loggly(LogType.Verbose, text: "Fun")
loggly(LogType.Debug, text: "is")
loggly(LogType.Warnings, text: "Matter")
loggly(LogType.Error, text: "here!!")

[üíô Info -  Jan 31, 2017, 1:52:38 PM]: Welcome to Swift Loggly
[üíú Warn -  Jan 31, 2017, 1:52:38 PM]: Fun
[üíö Error -  Jan 31, 2017, 1:52:38 PM]: is
[üíõ Error -  Jan 31, 2017, 1:52:38 PM]: Matter
[‚ù§Ô∏è Error -  Jan 31, 2017, 1:52:38 PM]: here!!

```

That will create a log file in the proper directory on both OS X and iOS.

OS X log files will be created in the OS X log directory (found under: /Library/Logs). The iOS log files will be created in your apps document directory under a folder called Logs.

## Configuration

There are a few configurable options in SwiftLog.

```swift
//This writes to the log
logglyInfo("Write to the log!")

//Set the name of the log files
Loggly.logger.name = "Sample" //default is "logglyfile"

//Set the max size of each log file. Value is in KB
Loggly.logger.maxFileSize = 2048 //default is 1024

//Set the max number of logs files that will be kept
Loggly.logger.maxFileCount = 8 //default is 4

//Set the directory in which the logs files will be written
Loggly.logger.directory = "/Library/XXX-folder-name-XXX" //default is the standard logging directory for each platform.

```
